# Coffee Machine

Coffee Machine is yet another project I've completed during my Java course on JetBrains Academy. Nothing too fancy yet, but I'm planning on making a GUI to it.
## Deployment

To run this project go to:

```bash
  \out\artifacts\CoffeeMachine_jar
```

download both files to the same directory on your PC

```bash
  \out\artifacts\CoffeeMachine.jar
  \out\artifacts\Coffee_runMe.bat
```

Run the .bat file.
